## SMART KEYS

Smart Keys provide special keys to use in your terminal session. Smart Keys are **only** visible when using the on screen keyboard, and hidden when using an external keyboard.

- Modifiers (i.e. `CTRL` ^, `ALT` ‚å•, and `ESC` ‚éã) for key combinations like `CTRL`+`C`.
- Arrow keys.
- Function and Alternate Cursor keys like Home, End, Page Down and Page Up when pressing `CMD` ‚åò.
- Scrollable area in the center with more keys
- Hold a modifier to chain multiple combinations, useful in applications like Emacs where you use chains like `C-x`, `C-c`.
